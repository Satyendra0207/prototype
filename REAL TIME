INTRODUCTION
This idea is completely based on the real life observation which we all have been through . It is related to our railway management ,
specifically berth allocation management using IOT and based on that I named it
 “REAL TIME BERTH CONFIRMATION SYSTEM”.

Motive behind this idea is to reduced the workload of the 
Train Ticket Examiner (TTE)of Indian Railways whose work is completely offline based in this era of Online . 

OBJECTIVE
The main objective behind this idea and observation is to mitigate the workload for TTE by automating the verification process (not completely) , 
involving the passengers who are travelling.

IMPLEMENTATION
STEP-1
SACN OF QR CODE AVAILABLE ON THE EACH BIRTH AND ALSO PASSENGERS MOBILE NO

STEP -2 
IRCTC LOGIN WEBSITE
LOGIN USING PNR NO 

STEP -3
LIST OF PASSENGER ASSOACIATED WITH THE PNR NO 
SELECT THE CHECK BOX OF YES TO NO TO SPECIFY YOUR STATUS OF OCCUPYING THE SEAT
HIT THE UPDATE BUTTON

STEP-4 
A SMALL SYSTEM AVAILABLE AT TTE'S CHAMBER WHERE ALL THE UPDATED INFORMATION IS PRESENT AND NOW HE HAS TO ONLY CHECK FOR THE SEATS WHOOSE STATUS IS NOT AVIALABLE

OUTCOME:
1- TTE and the administrator has now idea of which seat is occupied or not occupied 
2- With this they can allot seats to WL / RAC passengers.
3- TTE has to only concern about the seats whose status in Not available and has verify selected seats for their occupancy status 
4- Carrying of updated chart is resolved with just one device and real time monitoring of seats in at TTE’s hand 

RESULT
In this idea can not completely replace the TTE’s work because at the a person is needed to re verify and check personally,
but it can mitigates his work by limiting his number of verification that he has to do in every coach of 20-30 or more .
